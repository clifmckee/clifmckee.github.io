title: "Phylogenetic comparative methods for assessing cross-species transmission"
---

Pathogens frequently transmit between multiple closely related species in nature, but these processes are often unobserved due to lack of surveillance. Understanding the frequency and timing of these transmission events often has to been inferred from pathogen sequence data. Across several projects, I have used a combination of Bayesian phylogenetics, cophylogenetic approaches, and network analysis to understand how cross-species transmission of wildlife pathogens is structured by geography and host relatedness.
