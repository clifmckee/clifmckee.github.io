title: "Ecology and spillover of Nipah virus"
---

Nipah virus is a bat-borne infection that causes yearly outbreaks in Bangladesh with mortality >70% in human cases. I have contributed my expertise in bat biology and ecology to understand how human land use and animal behavior contribute to the emergence of Nipah virus at the human-animal interface. These insights are important for understanding how Nipah virus is maintained in bat populations and the seasonality of cross-species transmission to inform surveillance and prevention efforts.
