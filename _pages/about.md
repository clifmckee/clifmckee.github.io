I am an infectious disease ecologist interested in zoonotic pathogens and their dynamics within host populations and at the human-animal interface. Overall, my research sits firmly within One Health, seeking to understand disease emergence at the intersection between public health, animal ecology, and environmental change. I use a combination of statistical modeling, molecular genetics, and phylogenetics to investigate pathogen persistence in animal reservoirs, evolution of host specificity, and ecological drivers of pathogen spillover.

I am currently a Research Associate in the [Infectious Disease Dynamics](http://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu/) group at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. I work with Dr. Emily Gurley to study the ecology of Nipah virus, coronaviruses, and other viruses in bats in Bangladesh in collaboration with the broader [Bat One Health](https://batonehealth.org/) team. Using ongoing surveillance of bats, reported spillover events, and anthropological investigations, we try to understand the dynamics of virus transmission in bats and the ecological conditions that lead to human spillover events. In addition to my work with Dr. Gurley, I am involved in other projects related to COVID-19, including a systemic review of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events and supporting COVID-19 and influenza forecasting efforts through the [COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/) and [Flu Scenario Modeling Hub](https://fluscenariomodelinghub.org/).
