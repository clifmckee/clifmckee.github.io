I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu/). I study the effects of host and vector ecology on infection dynamics and pathogen diversification, with a particular focus on bacteria and viruses in bats. My CV is viewable [here](http://clifmckee.github.io/files/McKee-CV.pdf).
